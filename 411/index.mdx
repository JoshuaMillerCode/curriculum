# JavaScript Review

## Module Summary

This module serves as a review of key JavaScript concepts and techniques that learners have previously been exposed to. The focus will be on reinforcing foundational JavaScript skills such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, arrays, and DOM manipulation. Learners will also revisit more advanced concepts, including objects, event handling, and local storage. By the end of this module, learners will be well-prepared to apply these skills in more complex projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
- Explain and use JavaScript variables, functions, and data types.
- Perform mathematical operations and manipulate strings.
- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript methods.
- Utilize arrays and loops to process data efficiently.
- Implement conditional logic to control application flow.
- Create and use objects, including methods and properties.
- Store and retrieve data using local storage.
- Write cleaner code using template literals and function parameters.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, learners will be able to:
1. Demonstrate proficiency in using JavaScript data types, variables, and functions.
2. Use event listeners and DOM manipulation to dynamically update web content.
3. Apply JavaScript control structures such as loops and conditionals to solve common problems.
4. Create, manipulate, and iterate over arrays and objects.
5. Implement local storage to persist data across sessions.
6. Develop small interactive projects using core JavaScript concepts.
