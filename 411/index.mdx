# JavaScript Review

## Module Summary

This module serves as a review of key JavaScript concepts and techniques that learners have previously been exposed to. The focus will be on reinforcing foundational JavaScript skills such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, arrays, and DOM manipulation. Learners will also revisit more advanced concepts, including objects, event handling, and local storage. By the end of this module, learners will be well-prepared to apply these skills in more complex projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Explain and use JavaScript variables, functions, and data types.
- Perform mathematical operations and manipulate strings.
- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript methods.
- Utilize arrays and loops to process data efficiently.
- Implement conditional logic to control application flow.
- Create and use objects, including methods and properties.
- Store and retrieve data using local storage.
- Write cleaner code using template literals and function parameters.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, learners will be able to:

1. Demonstrate proficiency in using JavaScript data types, variables, and functions.
2. Use event listeners and DOM manipulation to dynamically update web content.
3. Apply JavaScript control structures such as loops and conditionals to solve common problems.
4. Create, manipulate, and iterate over arrays and objects.
5. Implement local storage to persist data across sessions.
6. Develop small interactive projects using core JavaScript concepts.

## Module Outline

#### Lesson 1: JavaScript Fundamentals Review

- **Time:** 2 hours
- **Topics:**
  - Variables and data types
  - Mathematical operations and string manipulation
  - Functions and parameters
- **Activities:**
  - Variable and function practice exercises
  - Small group discussion on common challenges
  - Interactive coding challenge: Create a simple math calculator
- **Knowledge Check:** Multiple-choice questions on variables, data types, and functions.

#### Lesson 2: DOM Manipulation & Event Handling

- **Time:** 1.5 hours
- **Topics:**
  - DOM elements and methods (`innerText`, `createElement`, `append`)
  - Event listeners (`onclick`, `addEventListener`)
- **Activities:**
  - Hands-on practice: Build a to-do list app with DOM manipulation and event listeners.
  - Code review and feedback on event-driven development.

#### Lesson 3: Arrays and Loops

- **Time:** 2 hours
- **Topics:**
  - Arrays (`push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`)
  - Looping through arrays with `for` loops and array methods
  - Rendering content dynamically with arrays and loops
- **Activities:**
  - Coding practice: Create a shopping cart using arrays and loops.
  - Group coding activity: Write a program that renders a list of tasks from an array.
- **Knowledge Check:** Multiple-choice questions on array methods and loops.

#### Lab: Variables and Functions Practice

- **Time:** 1 hour (asynchronous)
- **Task:** Solve coding challenges that require creating and manipulating variables and functions, logging results in the console.

#### Lab: Array Manipulation

- **Time:** 1 hour (asynchronous)
- **Task:** Use array methods to manipulate and display a list of items. Learners will write code to add, remove, and filter items within an array.

#### Lesson 4: Conditionals, Logical Operators, and Object Basics

- **Time:** 1.5 hours
- **Topics:**
  - `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
  - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
  - Object creation and usage
- **Activities:**
  - Hands-on activity: Build a simple game (e.g., rock-paper-scissors) using conditionals and objects.
  - Code review and feedback on object-oriented JavaScript.

#### Lesson 5: Advanced JavaScript Concepts Review

- **Time:** 1.5 hours
- **Topics:**
  - Template literals
  - Math methods (`Math.random`, `Math.floor`)
  - Function parameters and returning values
- **Activities:**
  - Create a random number generator with Math methods.
  - Coding activity: Use template literals to build dynamic strings for an interactive quiz.

### Final Assessments

#### Skills-Based Assessment (SBA)

- **Time:** 2 hours
- **Format:** Practical project
- **Activity:** Build an interactive JavaScript-based app that incorporates DOM manipulation, arrays, objects, conditionals, and local storage. For example, a simplified e-commerce site where users can add items to a shopping cart and store their cart data using local storage.
- **Deliverable:** Submit the project via GitHub and provide a brief reflection on the code structure and problem-solving approach.

#### Knowledge-Based Assessment (KBA)

- **Time:** 1.5 hours (asynchronous)
- **Format:** 20-30 multiple-choice or short-answer questions
- **Coverage:** Variables, functions, arrays, DOM manipulation, conditionals, objects, local storage.
- **Focus:** Practical understanding of JavaScript concepts through scenario-based questions and code snippets.
