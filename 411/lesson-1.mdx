# JavaScript Fundamentals, Template Literals, and Math Methods

## Workplace Context

You have just joined a new project, and your team expects you to hit the ground running by building new features using JavaScript. However, you first need to refresh your understanding of JavaScript basics like variables, data types, and functions. This training and the associated activities will review the foundational concepts that are critical for building interactive applications.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Declare and use variables to store data in JavaScript.
- Perform basic mathematical operations on variables.
- Create and call functions to organize and reuse code.

---

## Variables and Data Types

### What are Variables?

Variables are containers that store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var`.

```javascript
let username = "John";
const age = 25;
var isStudent = true;
```

- `let` allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned.
- `const` declares variables that cannot be reassigned.
- `var` is the older way of declaring variables but is generally avoided due to scope issues.

### Data Types

In JavaScript, common data types include:

- **Strings**: Used to represent text (`"Hello, World!"`).
- **Numbers**: Used for integers and decimals (`42`, `3.14`).
- **Booleans**: Represent true or false values (`true`, `false`).

### Template Literals

Template literals are a way to embed expressions into strings, making it easier to create dynamic text without complex concatenation. Template literals are enclosed in backticks (\` \`), and variables or expressions are embedded using `${ }`.

#### Example: Constructing a Dynamic String

Using the live editor below, edit the values of `name` and `age` and observe the output below.

<CodeEditor 
    template="vanilla"
    language="javascript"
    showConsole
    files={{
        "/index.js": `let name = "John";
let age = 30;
let greeting = \`Hello, my name is \${name} and I am \${age} years old.\`;

console.log(greeting);`
}} />

This method is more readable and concise compared to traditional string concatenation using the `+` operator:

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
```

---

## Basic Mathematical Operations

JavaScript supports standard mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
console.log(a + b); // 30
console.log(a * b); // 200
```

You can also increment and decrement variables using `++` and `--`.

```javascript
let count = 0;
count++;
console.log(count); // 1
count--;
console.log(count); // 0
```

---

## Functions and Parameters

### What is a Function?

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. You define a function using the `function` keyword.

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Parameters and Arguments

Functions can take **parameters**, which are inputs used inside the function.

```javascript
function greetUser(username) {
  console.log("Hello, " + username);
}
greetUser("John"); // Output: Hello, John
```

### Returning Values from Functions

Functions can also return values using the `return` statement.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
let sum = add(5, 10);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

## Functions with Multiple Parameters

Functions can accept multiple parameters, making them more flexible and reusable. Let us look at an example where we create a function to calculate the total cost of an item, including tax and discount.

### Example: Function with Multiple Parameters

<CodeEditor 
    template="vanilla"
    language="javascript"
    showConsole
    files={{
        "/index.js": `function calculateTotalCost(price, taxRate, discount) {
    let totalCost = (price - discount) * (1 + taxRate);
    return totalCost;
}

console.log(calculateTotalCost(100, 0.07, 10));`
}} />

In this example:

- `price`, `taxRate`, and `discount` are parameters passed to the function.
- The function calculates the total cost by subtracting the discount, adding the tax, and returning the final amount.

The initial example uses a `price` of 100, `taxRate` of 0.07, and `discount` of 10. Using the provided formula, this should output **96.3**, but instead the console shows **96.30000000000001**. Why is this?

JavaScript, like some other programming languages, is actually bad at math due to limitations on how computers handle storing numbers.

## JavaScript Math Methods

JavaScript provides several useful methods within the built-in `Math` object. These methods are essential for handling mathematical operations in your applications.

### Generating a Random Number

The `Math.random()` method generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

<CodeEditor 
    template="vanilla"
    language="javascript"
    showConsole
  files={{
    "/index.js": `let randomNumber = Math.random();
console.log(randomNumber);`,
  }}
/>

To generate a random integer within a specific range, you can combine `Math.random()` with `Math.floor()`.

<CodeEditor 
    template="vanilla"
    language="javascript"
    showConsole
  files={{
    "/index.js": `let randomInteger = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log(randomInteger); // Random number between 1 and 10`,
  }}
/>

**Critical Thinking:** Why must we add 1 to the `randomInteger` calculation? What would happen if we did not?

### Rounding Numbers

JavaScript provides different methods for rounding numbers, including:

- `Math.floor()`: Rounds down to the nearest integer.
- `Math.ceil()`: Rounds up to the nearest integer.
- `Math.round()`: Rounds to the nearest integer (up or down, depending on the decimal).

```javascript
console.log(Math.floor(4.9)); // Output: 4
console.log(Math.ceil(4.1)); // Output: 5
console.log(Math.round(4.5)); // Output: 5
```

## Activities

### Activity 1: Practice with Variables and Functions

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Instructions:**  
Write a simple program that:

1. Declares two variables (e.g., `x` and `y`) and assigns them values.
2. Creates a function that adds those two variables and returns the result.
3. Prints the result to the console.

**Hint:** Use the `function` keyword to define your function, and remember to return the sum.

---

### Activity 2: Group Discussion on Common Challenges

**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Instructions:**  
In small groups, discuss any challenges or misunderstandings you encountered during your prior experience related to variables or functions. Share solutions and best practices with your group.

---

### Activity 3: Interactive Coding Challenge: Create a Simple Calculator

**Time:** 40 minutes  
**Instructions:**  
Build a basic calculator that takes two inputs from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on user input.

1. Use `prompt()` to get input from the user.
2. Create a function for each mathematical operation.
3. Return and display the result using `console.log()` or in the browser using `alert()`.
