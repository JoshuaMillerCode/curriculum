# Skills-Based Assessment: Task Management App

## Overview

In this assessment, you will build a **Task Management App** that allows users to add tasks with deadlines, assign categories, and update the status of each task. This app will require you to apply a wide range of JavaScript concepts, including **arrays**, **objects**, **DOM manipulation**, **conditionals**, and **local storage** to persist the task data.

## Objective

You will create a dynamic task management app that lets users:

1. Add new tasks with details such as the task name, category, deadline, and status.
2. Update the status of tasks to reflect their progress (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed," "Overdue").
3. Automatically update task status based on the current date (tasks past their deadline will be marked as “Overdue”).
4. Filter tasks by status or category.
5. Persist task data using **local storage** so tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.

---

## Project Requirements

### 1. Adding New Tasks

- Create input fields for the **task name**, **category**, **deadline**, and an initial **status** (e.g., "In Progress").
- Include an "Add Task" button that will add the task to the task list.
- Each task should be stored as an **object** with properties such as task name, category, deadline, and status.
- Add the task object to an **array** that holds all tasks.

### 2. Displaying the Task List

- Create an HTML structure (such as an unordered list or table) to display the task list.
- For each task, display the **task name**, **category**, **deadline**, and **status**.
- Dynamically update the task list in the browser each time a new task is added or a status is updated.

### 3. Updating Task Status

- Allow users to **update the status** of tasks (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed") via a dropdown or button.
- Automatically check each task's deadline and mark tasks as **"Overdue"** if the current date has passed the deadline.
- Update the displayed task list whenever a task’s status changes.

### 4. Filtering Tasks

- Add functionality to **filter tasks** by category or status (e.g., show only "Completed" tasks or tasks under the "Work" category).
- Provide a dropdown or set of buttons for users to choose a filter.
- When a filter is selected, only display the tasks that match the selected category or status.

### 5. Persisting Task Data with Local Storage

- Use **local storage** to save the current state of the task list so that tasks are restored when the page is refreshed.
- Ensure that task data (including name, category, deadline, and status) is stored and retrieved correctly.

## Project Instructions

1. **Create the HTML Structure**

   - Input fields for task name, category, deadline, and status.
   - A button to add new tasks.
   - A dropdown or buttons to filter tasks by status or category.
   - A display area to show the list of tasks, including options to update task status.

2. **Write the JavaScript Code**

   - Use an array to store tasks, each represented as an object.
   - Write functions to add tasks, update task status, check overdue tasks, and filter tasks.
   - Use DOM manipulation to display the task list dynamically.
   - Implement local storage to persist task data.

3. **Test Your Application**
   - Add multiple tasks and ensure they are displayed correctly.
   - Test the "Update Status" functionality to ensure tasks can be marked as "Completed" or "Overdue."
   - Filter tasks by status or category and ensure the correct tasks are displayed.
   - Refresh the page and ensure the tasks are restored from local storage.

## Tips for Success

- **Break down the tasks**: Start with the core functionality (adding tasks and displaying them), then move to more complex features like filtering and local storage.
- **Test frequently**: Test each feature (e.g., task status updates or filters) separately to ensure they work correctly before moving on.
- **Keep your code modular**: Use functions to organize your logic and make your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Think about the user experience**: Ensure that the task list is easy to read and that users receive clear feedback when updating or filtering tasks.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Code Submission**: Push your project to a GitHub repository, and commit frequently throughout development. Ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and commented.

   - The repository should include:
     - `index.html`: The main HTML file.
     - `style.css`: CSS for styling the app.
     - `app.js`: The JavaScript file where your logic resides.
   - Include a brief `README.md` explaining how the app works and any additional features you have implemented.

2. **Reflection**: Write a short reflection (100-200 words) included within the repository discussing:

   - Challenges faced during the project.
   - How you approached solving those challenges.
   - What you would improve if given more time.

3. **Submission**: Submit the link to your GitHub repository via Canvas.
