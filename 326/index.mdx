# Foundations of Web Design

## Module Summary

This module provides a comprehensive overview of web design principles, introduces Figma as a key tool for design collaboration, and explores modern CSS libraries for efficient front-end development. Learners will gain hands-on experience with Figma for creating and collaborating on web designs and will be introduced to Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for styling and layout. By the end of this module, learners will have the skills to create responsive, user-friendly designs and implement them using popular CSS frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
- Describe the roles and responsibilities in web design and development teams.
- Use Figma to create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs.
- Collaborate effectively on design projects using Figma’s tools and features.
- Implement responsive designs using CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
- Customize CSS frameworks to fit project requirements and brand guidelines.
- Apply advanced features of Figma and CSS frameworks in real-world projects.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, learners will be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of web design roles and the design-to-development handoff process.
2. Create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs in Figma.
3. Collaborate with team members on design projects using Figma’s collaboration tools.
