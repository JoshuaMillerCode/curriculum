> All of the following information can be found on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0), but is included here for convenience and reference purposes.

## üìù Brief

In this challenge, you will be using two separate APIs together to create an IP Address Tracking app.

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you will be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## üí° Ideas to test yourself

1. Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/)
2. Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
3. Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers
