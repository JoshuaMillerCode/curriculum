# Project: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview

For this cumulative assessment on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will select and complete one of the following [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges:

1. [**IP Address Tracker**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0): Build an application that tracks and displays the location of a given IP address using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) and [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) for map rendering.

The code, briefs, and images for each challenge are included within this module as well, for reference.

This project aims to assess your ability to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course in a practical, real-world scenario. Choose the challenge that best aligns with your interests and strengths, and demonstrate your proficiency in front-end development.

## Time Allotment

- **Time:** Four (4) days

> **Note:** This is a **full-time** project which you will be given class time to work on. You may work on the project outside of class, including on holidays and weekends, if necessary.

The project will be **due by the start of the fifth class day after being assigned.**

---

## Project Requirements

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes.
- **API Integration**: Effectively integrate the specified API to fetch and display data dynamically.
- **Interactivity**: Implement interactive elements such as search functionality, form validation, and dynamic content updates.
- **Accessibility**: Follow best practices to make the application accessible to all users.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, with regular commits and a well-documented GitHub repository.
- **Documentation**: Include a comprehensive README.md file detailing the project setup, features, and any additional notes.

## Getting Started

Start by reviewing each project's description, brief, and associated images, then choose the challenge that aligns most with your skills and interests.

Once you've selected a project:
- Download the starter files.
- Initialize a git repository.
- Plan your application structure.
- Begin coding and implementing the project's features.

### Required Research

Each of the project options intentionally includes things you may not be familiar with, such as new APIs, new libraries, or new concepts. You will be required to research and learn about these new technologies throughout the project.

While the research requirements will vary depending on the project you select, you will absolutely need to research **deployment** as it is one of the required submission requirements below.

**Deployment** is the act of making a web application accessible on a public URL. It is a crucial step in the project process, as it allows you to share and test your work with others. We have included a [Required Reading] section on deployment within this module to get you started. You may review this material at any point during the project timeline.

## Submission Requirements

1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Host your project on GitHub with all source code and assets.
   - Ensure the repository is public and includes a detailed `README.md` file.

2. **Live Demo**:
   - Deploy your application using a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
   - Provide a link to the live demo in your `README.md` file.

3. **Reflection Document**:
   - Write a 200-300 word reflection discussing your development process, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and potential improvements.
   - Include this reflection in your GitHub repository.
