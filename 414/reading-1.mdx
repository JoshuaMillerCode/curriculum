# Deploying Static Web Applications

Deploying your web application is a crucial step in making it accessible to users worldwide. Without deploying the application to the internet, it only exists on your local machine, which is not very useful! This guide introduces free deployment platforms and provides resources to help you get started.

## Static Sites vs. Full-Stack Applications in Deployment

Static sites consist of fixed content — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — that doesn't change unless the source code is modified. They are straightforward to deploy and can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and Render without server-side processing.

**This module's project is considered a static site.**

Full-stack applications, on the other hand, include both front-end and back-end components. They require server-side processing, databases, and dynamic content generation. Deploying full-stack applications involves setting up servers, managing databases, and ensuring proper communication between the client and server. Platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and Render support full-stack deployments by offering serverless functions and backend services.

By exploring these resources, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of various deployment platforms and processes, enabling you to choose the best option for your project's needs.

## Recommended Deployment Options

This list is not exhaustive, and contains only **free** deployment options. If any of the options below require you to enter payment information, you are not required to use them. As of time of writing, all of these options are free.

If you are familiar with another deployment platform, you can also use it for this project with your instructor's permission; however, we recommend exploring additional options to expand your skillset.

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's free and easy to set up, making it a popular choice for small projects.

While GitHub Pages is ideal for projects that don't require server-side processing, it falls short when you need to deploy full-stack applications. For this reason, we recommend exploring the other deployment options listed below to familiarize yourself with them for future projects, even if you decide to use GitHub Pages for this project.
