## üìù Brief

If you are wanting to test your JavaScript skills this is the challenge for you. Use whichever JS framework you prefer and pull data from the REST Countries API.

Your challenge is integrating with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus:** Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

Download the starter code and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.md` file is where you will find colors, fonts, etc.

## üí° Ideas to test yourself

1. Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/)
2. Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
3. Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers
