## üìù Brief

Integrate with the Clean URI link shortening API and play with browser storage in this landing page challenge.

Your challenge is to integrate with the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs) to create shortened URLs and display them like in the designs.

You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - The `input` field is empty
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the starter code and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.md` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

## üí° Ideas to test yourself

1. Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/)
2. Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
3. Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers
