# Resolving Conflicts and Reviewing Pull Requests

## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore how to handle **merge conflicts** and how to manage **pull requests** on GitHub. Merge conflicts arise when two branches have conflicting changes. Understanding how to resolve conflicts is key to maintaining a healthy codebase. Additionally, pull requests are essential for collaborating with others, allowing teams to review and approve changes before they are merged into the main branch.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Resolve merge conflicts in Git.
- Create and manage pull requests on GitHub.
- Review and approve changes made by others through pull requests.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

A **merge conflict** occurs when changes in two branches affect the same line in a file, and Git cannot decide which changes to keep.

### Step-by-Step: Resolving a Merge Conflict

1. **Trigger a merge conflict**:
   Merge conflicts happen naturally in team environments when different branches modify the same file. For this example, imagine two branches, `main` and `feature`, both modify the same line in `index.html`.

2. **Attempt to merge**:
   Switch to the `main` branch and attempt to merge the `feature` branch:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   $ git merge feature
   ```

   Git will detect the conflict and notify you with a message:

   ```
   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
   ```

3. **Identify the conflict**:
   Open the conflicting file. Git marks the conflicting sections like this:

   ```html
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   <h1>Main Branch Heading</h1>
   =======
   <h1>Feature Branch Heading</h1>
   >>>>>>> feature
   ```

   The lines between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represent changes from the `main` branch, and the lines between `=======` and `>>>>>>> feature` represent changes from the `feature` branch.

4. **Resolve the conflict**:
   Edit the file to keep the desired changes and remove the conflict markers. For example:

   ```html
   <h1>Final Heading</h1>
   ```

5. **Mark the conflict as resolved**:
   After editing the file and removing the conflict markers, stage the file:

   ```bash
   $ git add index.html
   ```

6. **Complete the merge**:
   Now, complete the merge with a commit:
   ```bash
   $ git commit
   ```

## Working with Pull Requests

A **pull request (PR)** is a way to propose changes in a repository. Before the changes are merged, the team can review and discuss the code.

### Step-by-Step: Creating and Reviewing a Pull Request

1. **Create a Pull Request**:

   - On GitHub, go to the repository’s page.
   - Switch to the branch with your changes (e.g., `feature/my-feature`).
   - Click on the **Pull Request** tab and then the **New Pull Request** button.
   - Select the branches to compare (e.g., compare `feature/my-feature` with `main`).
   - Add a description of your changes and submit the pull request.

2. **Review the Pull Request**:

   - A teammate can review the pull request by going to the **Pull Request** tab and clicking on the open pull request.
   - Reviewers can comment on lines of code, suggest changes, or approve the pull request.

3. **Merge the Pull Request**:

   - Once the pull request has been reviewed and approved, click **Merge** to integrate the changes into the main branch.

4. **Handle Conflicts**:
   - If there are any conflicts, GitHub will notify you before the merge. Follow the same conflict resolution steps to resolve the conflicts.

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to handle **merge conflicts** in Git and how to create and manage **pull requests** on GitHub. Merge conflicts are an inevitable part of collaboration, and mastering them ensures smooth development workflows. Additionally, pull requests are a crucial aspect of collaborating with others, allowing for code review and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.

In the next lesson, we’ll explore best practices for code reviews and discuss how to automate pull request workflows with GitHub Actions.
