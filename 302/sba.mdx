# Version Control Skills-Based Assessment (SBA)

## Overview

In this assessment, you will apply the skills you've learned throughout the Version Control module in a **real-world Git project simulation**. This project will challenge your ability to manage branches, handle merge conflicts, submit pull requests, and collaborate with others using GitHub.

You will set up a GitHub repository, work with branches, simulate team collaboration by resolving conflicts, and submit pull requests. The final deliverable will include the **link to your GitHub repository** and a **reflection** on the steps you followed to complete the project.

## Time Allotment

- **Time:** 2 hours

## Instructions

### Part 1: Set Up the Repository

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository**:

   - Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com) account and create a new repository.
   - Name the repository as follows: `version-control-simulation-[yourname]`.
   - Do not initialize the repository with a README or any other files (this will be done locally).
   - Copy the repository URL for future use.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/version-control-simulation-[yourname].git
   ```

---

### Part 2: Create and Manage Branches

1. **Create a New Branch for a Feature**:

   - In your local repository, create a new branch called `feature/header` to simulate working on the header section of a webpage:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b feature/header
   ```

2. **Make Changes in the Feature Branch**:

   - Create a simple `index.html` file, and add a basic HTML structure with a header.
   - Stage and commit the changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add index.html
   $ git commit -m "Added header section to index.html"
   ```

3. **Switch Back to Main**:
   - Switch back to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   ```

---

### Part 3: Simulate a Merge Conflict

1. **Create a New Branch for Another Feature**:

   - Create another branch called `feature/footer` to simulate working on a different feature:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b feature/footer
   ```

2. **Make Changes in the New Branch**:

   - In `index.html`, add a footer element at the bottom of the file.
   - Stage and commit the changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add index.html
   $ git commit -m "Added footer section to index.html"
   ```

3. **Switch Back to `feature/header`**:

   - Now, switch back to the `feature/header` branch and modify the `index.html` file by changing something in the footer section to simulate a conflict.

4. **Merge `feature/footer` into `main`**:

   - Merge the `feature/footer` branch into `main`:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   $ git merge feature/footer
   ```

5. **Attempt to Merge `feature/header`**:

   - Now, try merging the `feature/header` branch into `main`:

   ```bash
   $ git merge feature/header
   ```

6. **Resolve the Conflict**:
   - A merge conflict will occur. Open the conflicting file, resolve the conflict, and commit the resolved changes.
   - Use `git status` to ensure all conflicts are resolved, then:
   ```bash
   $ git add index.html
   $ git commit
   ```

---

### Part 4: Submit a Pull Request and Review Peers' Work

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**:

   - Push your changes to GitHub:

   ```bash
   $ git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**:

   - On GitHub, create a **pull request** from your `main` branch to a new branch called `review/main`.
   - Add a description of the changes you made in the pull request.

3. **Simulate Reviewing a Pull Request**:
   - Find a peer’s repository (shared through Canvas).
   - Review their pull request, add comments, and approve or request changes.

---

### Deliverables

You must submit the following through **Canvas** by the due date:

1. **GitHub Repository Link**:

   - Submit the URL to your GitHub repository where your work is stored.

2. **Project Reflection**:

   - In a document or Markdown file, write a reflection of approximately 300 words, addressing the following:
     - The steps you took to create and manage branches.
     - How you handled the merge conflict.
     - How the pull request process helped you ensure code quality and collaboration.

3. **Peer Review Evidence**:
   - Provide a screenshot or link showing that you reviewed a peer’s pull request on GitHub. Include a brief description of your review (e.g., comments, approval, or requested changes).
