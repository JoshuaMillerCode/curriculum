# Basic Git Commands and Repositories

## Scenario

You have been tasked with building a new feature for your company's website. To ensure that your work is tracked and can be easily collaborated on by your team, you need to use Git for version control. In this lesson, you will learn how to use basic Git commands to manage and track changes in your project. You’ll create a repository, stage changes, and commit them. Understanding these fundamental commands is critical to managing your code efficiently and working seamlessly with your team.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Use Git commands to initialize a repository, track, and commit changes.
- Explain how to stage and commit files to the repository.
- Demonstrate how to view the history of changes using `git log`.
- Revert changes using `git reset` and `git checkout`.

## Initializing a Git Repository

Once you have created your project and set up your GitHub account, you can start using Git to track your changes.

### Step-by-Step: Initializing a Repository

1. **Navigate to Your Project Folder**:
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your project files are located.

   ```bash
   $ cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Initialize the Repository**:
   Run the following command to initialize Git in your project directory. This will create a `.git` folder, which is where Git will track all the changes in your project.

   ```bash
   $ git init
   ```

3. **Check Git Status**:
   Use the `git status` command to see the state of your repository. It will show you any untracked files or changes that haven't been committed yet.
   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

## Staging and Committing Changes

### What Are Staging and Committing?

- **Staging**: When you modify files, Git does not automatically start tracking those changes. You need to stage the files that you want to include in the next commit.
- **Committing**: After staging the files, you create a commit, which is a snapshot of your project at that point in time. Commits allow you to go back and see the history of your project and revert to previous versions if needed.

### Step-by-Step: Staging and Committing Changes

1. **Create or Modify a File**:
   Create or modify a file in your project. For example, let's create an `index.html` file and add some basic content:

   ```html
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My Project</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Stage the File**:
   Use the `git add` command to stage the file. You can stage individual files or stage all changes at once.

   ```bash
   $ git add index.html
   ```

   To stage all files at once, use:

   ```bash
   $ git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the Changes**:
   Once the file is staged, commit the changes with a descriptive message. The commit message helps others (and yourself) understand what changes were made.
   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Added basic structure to index.html"
   ```

## Viewing the Commit History with `git log`

After making multiple commits, you may want to review the history of changes in your project. The `git log` command allows you to see all the commits made, who made them, and when they were made.

### Step-by-Step: Using `git log`

1. **View the Commit History**:
   Run the `git log` command to see a list of all the commits in your repository.

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```

   The output will show each commit’s hash (a unique identifier), the author, the date, and the commit message.

   Example output:

   ```bash
   commit 2c4f4b8b9c4e5a7b896f1f94e9381bf3624fdf43
   Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   Date:   Wed Sep 4 14:33:00 2024 +0100

       Added basic structure to index.html
   ```

## Reverting Changes with `git reset` and `git checkout`

Sometimes, you may want to undo changes or go back to a previous version of your project. Git provides commands to help you do this safely.

### Step-by-Step: Reverting Changes

1. **Unstage Changes**:
   If you have staged changes but decide you do not want to include them in the commit, you can unstage them using:

   ```bash
   $ git reset index.html
   ```

2. **Revert to a Previous Commit**:
   If you need to roll back your project to a previous commit, you can use `git checkout`:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout <commit-hash>
   ```

   This command will switch your project to an earlier version, but be careful—this can make changes that are not committed yet disappear. Make sure your work is saved before reverting!

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use Git to initialize a repository, stage files, commit changes, and view the history of your project using `git log`. These fundamental commands allow you to keep track of your work, manage different versions of your project, and collaborate with your team.

Next, we will explore how to push your changes to a remote repository like GitHub and collaborate with others.
