# Version Control Primer

## Module Summary

This module introduces the foundational concepts of version control using Git and GitHub. You will learn how to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others using remote repositories, and manage branches for feature development. The course will also incorporate basic command line navigation, providing you with the skills to interact with your repositories efficiently.

By the end of this module, you will be able to apply version control in real-world development projects, collaborate with team members, and resolve conflicts using Git and GitHub workflows.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the fundamentals of version control and explain its importance in software development projects.
- Apply basic Git commands to manage project versions.
- Collaborate on projects using GitHub for remote repositories.
- Use industry-standard Git processes such as branches and merging.
- Handle pull request reviews and resolve merge conflicts.
- Navigate and perform essential tasks in the command line interface (CLI).

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain the basic concepts of version control and the role of Git in modern development workflows.
2. Use Git to initialize repositories, track changes, and manage your project history.
3. Collaborate with others by pushing and pulling changes to and from GitHub repositories.
4. Create and manage branches, merge feature branches into the main project, and resolve conflicts effectively.
5. Review and handle pull requests in GitHub, ensuring code quality and managing collaborative contributions.
6. Navigate and use the command line to interact with Git and perform file management operations.
