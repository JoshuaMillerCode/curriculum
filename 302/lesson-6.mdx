# Best Practices for Code Reviews and Automating Workflows

## Scenario

Your team has been working hard on several features for a new web application. As a senior developer, you are responsible for reviewing your teammates' code before it gets merged into the `main` branch. Additionally, your team has decided to automate parts of the development process, such as running tests and linting the code, to ensure that only high-quality code is merged.

In this lesson, you will learn the **best practices for code reviews** and how to set up **automated workflows** using tools like **GitHub Actions**. These practices will help streamline the development process, ensure consistency, and improve the overall quality of the codebase.

## Pre-Requisite: Node.js and npm

### Node.js Overview

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer outside of a web browser. It is commonly used for server-side development and enables developers to use JavaScript to build backend applications, scripts, and automation tools.

**Why Do You Need Node.js?**
In this lesson, you will use Node.js to install development tools, run scripts, and automate workflows. Many modern development tools, such as linters (e.g., **ESLint**) and testing frameworks (e.g., **Jest**), require Node.js to work properly.

### npm Overview

**npm** stands for **Node Package Manager**. It is the default package manager for Node.js and is used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages (libraries or tools).

**Why Do You Need npm?**
npm allows you to easily install and manage tools like **ESLint** for linting code, **Jest** for testing, and **GitHub Actions** for automating workflows. It also helps you manage dependencies for your projects.

## Installing Node.js and npm

### Step-by-Step: Installing Node.js and npm

#### On Windows

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Go to the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
   - Download the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version, as it is more stable for development purposes.
2. **Install Node.js**:

   - Run the installer you downloaded.
   - Follow the prompts to install Node.js. This will also install **npm** automatically.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open the **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
   - Run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm have been installed correctly:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm. If so, the installation was successful.

#### On macOS

1. **Download Node.js**:

   - Visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the **LTS** version of Node.js for macOS.

2. **Install Node.js**:

   - Open the downloaded installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js. This will also install **npm**.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open the **Terminal**.
   - Run the following commands to verify the installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm, indicating a successful installation.

#### On Linux

1. **Install Node.js** via the package manager for your distribution (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu):

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run the following commands to check that Node.js and npm are installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) for detailed troubleshooting.

## Best Practices for Code Reviews

Now that you have Node.js and npm set up, let us explore how to conduct effective code reviews.

### 1. **Review Code in Small Increments**

- Reviewing smaller, incremental changes is easier and more manageable than reviewing large blocks of code. Encourage your teammates to submit pull requests (PRs) that contain well-scoped changes.
- Smaller PRs allow for faster reviews, quicker feedback, and more focused discussions.

### 2. **Focus on Readability and Maintainability**

- Ensure that the code is easy to understand. Can someone new to the project quickly grasp what the code does?
- Check that variable names, function names, and class names are descriptive and follow your team’s naming conventions.

### 3. **Look for Consistency**

- Code consistency helps maintain a clean codebase and improves collaboration. Check for consistent formatting, indentation, and structure.
- Tools like **Prettier** or **ESLint** can be used to automate code formatting and linting to ensure that the style remains uniform across the project.

### 4. **Check for Efficiency**

- Review the code for performance improvements or optimizations. Does the code contain unnecessary loops or duplicated logic? Can the same task be accomplished with fewer resources?
- Encourage the use of efficient algorithms and data structures where applicable.

### 5. **Ensure Security Best Practices**

- Look for common security issues, such as unvalidated user input, hard-coded credentials, or insecure handling of sensitive data.
- Ensure that the code adheres to security best practices such as input validation, authentication, and proper error handling.

### 6. **Give Constructive Feedback**

- When providing feedback, be specific and actionable. Instead of saying “this is wrong,” suggest improvements and explain why they are necessary.
- Maintain a positive tone and encourage collaborative discussion. For example: “I noticed this function could be simplified by using a higher-order function, which might improve readability.”

## Automating Code Reviews with GitHub Actions

Manual code reviews can miss important issues, especially if team members are reviewing large or complex codebases. **Automation** can complement human reviews by enforcing coding standards, running tests, and even detecting security vulnerabilities before code is merged.

### 1. **What Are GitHub Actions?**

**GitHub Actions** is a tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can use it to:

- Automatically run tests.
- Enforce code quality by running linters.
- Deploy applications after a successful merge.

Automation helps catch issues early and reduces the manual effort required to maintain a high-quality codebase.

### 2. **Setting Up a Simple Workflow with GitHub Actions**

Let us walk through how to set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and lint the code whenever a pull request is opened.

#### Step-by-Step: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create a Workflow File**:

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows/` directory (create it if it does not exist).
   - Add a new file named `ci.yml` for your continuous integration (CI) workflow.

2. **Configure the Workflow**:

   - Here is an example of a simple workflow that runs tests and checks for code linting using Node.js:

     ```yaml
     name: CI Workflow

     on:
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2

           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: "14"

           - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm install

           - name: Run tests
             run: npm test

           - name: Run lint
             run: npm run lint
     ```

   - This workflow is triggered automatically whenever a pull request is opened. It checks out the code, installs dependencies, and runs the tests and linting tasks.
   - You will become more familiar with these npm commands and other items as you continue learning, so do not worry about memorizing them now.

3. **Commit the Workflow File**:
   - Once the workflow file is created, commit it to your repository. GitHub Actions will start running the workflow whenever a pull request is submitted to the `main` branch.

## Activity: Setting Up Automated Workflows

### Task: Automate Your Project’s CI Workflow

1. **Set Up ESLint**:

   - Install ESLint in your project and configure it with your preferred rules. Ensure that the linter runs automatically whenever code is pushed or a pull request is submitted.

2. **Submit a Pull Request**:

   - Create a pull request in your project. The GitHub Actions workflow you have set up will automatically check your code for issues and run your tests.

3. **Review a Pull Request**:
   - Pair with a classmate and review each other’s pull requests. Ensure that the automated workflow runs successfully before approving and merging the PR.
