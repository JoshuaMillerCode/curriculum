## Pre-Requisite: Node.js and npm

### Node.js Overview

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer outside of a web browser. It is commonly used for server-side development and enables developers to use JavaScript to build backend applications, scripts, and automation tools.

**Why Do You Need Node.js?**
In this lesson, you will use Node.js to install development tools, run scripts, and automate workflows. Many modern development tools, such as linters (e.g., **ESLint**) and testing frameworks (e.g., **Jest**), require Node.js to work properly.

### npm Overview

**npm** stands for **Node Package Manager**. It is the default package manager for Node.js and is used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages (libraries or tools).

**Why Do You Need npm?**
npm allows you to easily install and manage tools like **ESLint** for linting code, **Jest** for testing, and **GitHub Actions** for automating workflows. It also helps you manage dependencies for your projects.

## Best Practices for Code Reviews

Now that you have Node.js and npm set up, let us explore how to conduct effective code reviews.

### 1. Review Code in Small Increments

- Reviewing smaller, incremental changes is easier and more manageable than reviewing large blocks of code. Encourage your teammates to submit pull requests (PRs) that contain well-scoped changes.
- Smaller PRs allow for faster reviews, quicker feedback, and more focused discussions.

### 2. Focus on Readability and Maintainability

- Ensure that the code is easy to understand. Can someone new to the project quickly grasp what the code does?
- Check that variable names, function names, and class names are descriptive and follow your team’s naming conventions.

### 3. Look for Consistency

- Code consistency helps maintain a clean codebase and improves collaboration. Check for consistent formatting, indentation, and structure.
- Tools like **Prettier** or **ESLint** can be used to automate code formatting and linting to ensure that the style remains uniform across the project.

### 4. Check for Efficiency

- Review the code for performance improvements or optimizations. Does the code contain unnecessary loops or duplicated logic? Can the same task be accomplished with fewer resources?
- Encourage the use of efficient algorithms and data structures where applicable.

### 5. Ensure Security Best Practices

- Look for common security issues, such as unvalidated user input, hard-coded credentials, or insecure handling of sensitive data.
- Ensure that the code adheres to security best practices such as input validation, authentication, and proper error handling.

### 6. Give Constructive Feedback

- When providing feedback, be specific and actionable. Instead of saying “this is wrong,” suggest improvements and explain why they are necessary.
- Maintain a positive tone and encourage collaborative discussion. For example: “I noticed this function could be simplified by using a higher-order function, which might improve readability.”

## Automating Code Reviews with GitHub Actions

Manual code reviews can miss important issues, especially if team members are reviewing large or complex codebases. **Automation** can complement human reviews by enforcing coding standards, running tests, and even detecting security vulnerabilities before code is merged.

### 1. What Are GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can use it to:

- Automatically run tests.
- Enforce code quality by running linters.
- Deploy applications after a successful merge.

Automation helps catch issues early and reduces the manual effort required to maintain a high-quality codebase.

### 2. Setting Up a Simple Workflow with GitHub Actions

Let us walk through how to set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and lint the code whenever a pull request is opened.

#### Step-by-Step: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create a Workflow File**:

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows/` directory (create it if it does not exist).
   - Add a new file named `ci.yml` for your continuous integration (CI) workflow.

2. **Configure the Workflow**:

   - Here is an example of a simple workflow that runs tests and checks for code linting using Node.js:

     ```yaml
     name: CI Workflow

     on:
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2

           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: "14"

           - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm install

           - name: Run tests
             run: npm test

           - name: Run lint
             run: npm run lint
     ```

   - This workflow is triggered automatically whenever a pull request is opened. It checks out the code, installs dependencies, and runs the tests and linting tasks.
   - You will become more familiar with these npm commands and other items as you continue learning, so do not worry about memorizing them now.

3. **Commit the Workflow File**:
   - Once the workflow file is created, commit it to your repository. GitHub Actions will start running the workflow whenever a pull request is submitted to the `main` branch.

---

## Activity: Setting Up Automated Workflows

### Task: Automate Your Project’s CI Workflow

1. **Set Up ESLint**:

   - Install ESLint in your project and configure it with your preferred rules. Ensure that the linter runs automatically whenever code is pushed or a pull request is submitted.

2. **Submit a Pull Request**:

   - Create a pull request in your project. The GitHub Actions workflow you have set up will automatically check your code for issues and run your tests.

3. **Review a Pull Request**:
   - Pair with a classmate and review each other’s pull requests. Ensure that the automated workflow runs successfully before approving and merging the PR.

## Aside: GitHub Desktop

It is **incredibly important** to be familiar with git and GitHub in order to be a successful developer. Interviews for developer positions often include questions on version control and workflow, so it is highly recommended you become familiar with the command line interface, git commands, and keeping your hands on the keyboard.

However, there is also a graphical interface available for managing version control in your projects called [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop), which is often more convenient. You may explore this interface as you continue learning, but ensure you are aware of the foundational concepts of version control that are happening in the background!

![The image shows a GitHub Desktop user interface with three changed files listed on the left, including `section-list.tsx`, `tooltip.tsx`, and `tooltipped-content.tsx`. The center panel shows the code changes for `section-list.tsx`, highlighting new lines of code that define readonly properties for event handlers, such as `onRowFocus`, `onRowKeyboardFocus`, and `onRowBlur`. The changes include functions that will be triggered when a row gains focus, when focus is obtained via keyboard, and when focus is lost. At the bottom of the screen, a commit message box is visible with the text "Bring `onRowKeyboardFocus` to SectionList." Two co-authors are mentioned (`sergiou87` and `tidy-dev`), and the commit button reads "Commit to file-status-tooltip."](/curriculum-assets/302/github-desktop.png)

## Examples from Industry

### React Repository

Head over one last (probably not) time to [the React repository on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react), this time to explore the GitHub Actions that are currently associated with the repository.

Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository, which should bring you to [the actions page for the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react/actions). Here, you can see which actions are active, which branches they are active on, when the last time they were run is, how long they took to run, and a number of other important pieces of information.

Take a look through some of the active actions, and try to identify their purpose and method. While the scripts involved in each action may be unfamiliar territory, the actions themselves should contain descriptive enough steps to understand them (most of the time).

GitHub actions could be an entire training session on their own, and thus you are not expected to be experts in them at this stage; however, it is a wonderful tool to explore as you continue training!

As a bonus, look through some more pull requests with the added context of code review best practices, and observe how reviews occur in the real world!
