# Branching and Merging in Git

## Scenario

Your team is working on several new features for your company's website, and each developer is responsible for a different part of the project. You need to work on the **new homepage design**, while a teammate is adding new functionality to the **shopping cart**. To avoid conflicts and ensure everyone can work independently, you decide to create a **branch** for your feature. Once your work is done, you will need to **merge** your changes back into the main branch.

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and manage branches in Git, merge branches, and handle merge conflicts when they occur.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create and switch between branches in Git.
- Merge branches to combine different lines of development.
- Resolve merge conflicts that occur during the merging process.

---

## Creating Branches in Git

A **branch** is a parallel version of your project that allows you to work on a new feature or fix without affecting the main branch. This is especially useful in teams where multiple developers are working on different parts of the project simultaneously.

### Step-by-Step: Creating a Branch

1. **Check the Current Branch**:
   Before creating a new branch, it is important to check which branch you are currently on:

   ```bash
   $ git branch
   ```

   Output example:

   ```bash
   * main
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**:
   Create a new branch for the feature you are working on (e.g., `feature/homepage-design`):

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b feature/homepage-design
   ```

   This command creates the branch and switches you to it.

3. **List All Branches**:
   To see all the branches in your repository, use:

   ```bash
   $ git branch
   ```

   Output example:

   ```bash
   * feature/homepage-design
     main
   ```

## Merging Branches in Git

After completing work on your branch, you will want to **merge** your changes into the `main` branch. Merging combines the changes from one branch into another.

### Step-by-Step: Merging Branches

1. **Switch to the `main` Branch**:
   Before merging, you need to be on the branch that you want to merge into (e.g., `main`):

   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   ```

2. **Merge the Feature Branch**:
   Merge your feature branch into `main`:

   ```bash
   $ git merge feature/homepage-design
   ```

   This command incorporates the changes from the `feature/homepage-design` branch into `main`.

3. **View Merge Confirmation**:
   Git will confirm the merge and show a log of the merged commits:
   ```bash
   Updating a1b2c3d..d4e5f6g
   Fast-forward
   index.html | 1 +
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   ```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, two branches make changes to the same part of a file. This creates a **merge conflict** because Git cannot automatically decide which changes to keep.

### What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict happens when two developers have modified the same lines in a file on different branches. Git will flag this as a conflict, and you will need to manually resolve it.

### Step-by-Step: Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. **Trigger a Merge Conflict**:
   Let us assume both the `main` and `feature/homepage-design` branches have changes to the `index.html` file. When you try to merge, Git will notify you of the conflict:

   ```
   Auto-merging index.html
   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
   ```

2. **Identify the Conflict**:
   Open the conflicting file. Git will mark the conflicting sections with special markers:

   ```html
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   <h1>Welcome to the Shop</h1>
   =======
   <h1>New Homepage Title</h1>
   >>>>>>> feature/homepage-design
   ```

   The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` shows the content from the `main` branch, and the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> feature/homepage-design` shows the content from the feature branch.

3. **Resolve the Conflict**:
   Edit the file to resolve the conflict. You can either keep one version or combine them. For example:

   ```html
   <h1>Welcome to the New Homepage</h1>
   ```

4. **Stage and Commit the Resolved Changes**:
   After resolving the conflict, stage the resolved file and commit the changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add index.html
   $ git commit
   ```

   Git will now record the merge as complete.

## Activity: Learn Git Branching Challenges

To further practice your branching and merging skills, complete the interactive challenges on **[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)**. The following exercises are highly recommended:

1. **Introduction Sequence: "Branching in Git"**:
   - Learn the fundamentals of creating branches, committing to them, and switching between them.
2. **Push & Pull â€“ Remote Branches**:

   - Explore how to manage branches that exist both locally and on a remote server.

3. **Advanced Sequence: "Rebasing and Merging"**:
   - Practice handling merge conflicts and advanced branch operations.

These challenges provide a visual and hands-on way to solidify your understanding of branching and merging, while simulating real-world workflows.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use Git to create and manage branches, merge branches into the main project, and resolve merge conflicts. Understanding branching and merging is critical for working on projects where multiple developers are contributing to the same codebase. To further solidify your skills, complete the challenges on **[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)**.
