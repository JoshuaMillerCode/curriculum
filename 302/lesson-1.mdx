# Introduction to Version Control and Command Line Basics

## Overview

In this lesson, we will introduce the concepts of **version control** and the **command line interface (CLI)**, two fundamental tools in software development. You will learn how version control helps you keep track of changes in your projects and how the command line allows you to interact with your computer in a more efficient way. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand the basics of version control and be able to perform simple tasks using the command line.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Describe the purpose and importance of version control in software development.
- Perform basic file management tasks using the command line.
- Understand how Git helps track changes in a project.

---

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that helps you manage and track changes to files over time. Think of it like a **history** for your project. Every time you make a change to a file (or a set of files), version control can save a "snapshot" of those changes. This makes it easier to:

- **Revert** to a previous version of your project if something goes wrong.
- **Collaborate** with others on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
- **Track** who made changes and when they were made.

Version control is especially useful for **software development**, where many people might be working on the same code at the same time.

## Introduction to Git

**Git** is a popular version control system used by millions of developers around the world. It helps you:

- Track changes in your project.
- Collaborate with others by allowing multiple people to work on the same project.
- Revert to previous versions of your project when needed.

### Key Features of Git:

- **Repository (Repo):** A place where all the snapshots of your project are stored.
- **Commit:** A "snapshot" of the changes you made to your project.
- **Staging Area:** A space where changes are prepared before being saved (committed).

We will explore these concepts more deeply as we progress through the module.

## Introduction to the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The **command line interface (CLI)** is a way to interact with your computer by typing commands instead of using the mouse to click on icons. While it might seem intimidating at first, using the command line allows you to **work faster and more efficiently** as a developer.

In this lesson, we will learn a few basic commands to navigate through your files and folders.

---

## Basic Command Line Navigation

### Common CLI Commands

Here are some basic commands to get started with the command line:

1. **`pwd` (Print Working Directory):** This command shows you which folder (directory) you are currently in.

   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     $ pwd
     /Users/yourname/projects
     ```
     This tells you that you are currently inside the `projects` folder.

2. **`ls` (List):** This command lists all the files and folders in your current directory.

   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     $ ls
     README.md  index.html  styles.css
     ```
     This shows the files in the current folder.

3. **`cd` (Change Directory):** This command allows you to move to a different folder.

   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     $ cd projects
     ```
     This moves you into the `projects` folder.

4. **`mkdir` (Make Directory):** This command creates a new folder.

   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     $ mkdir my-new-project
     ```

5. **`rm` (Remove):** This command deletes a file or folder (use with caution!).
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     $ rm old-file.txt
     ```

## Activity: Terminus Game for CLI Practice

Now that you’ve learned some basic commands, it’s time to practice using the command line with a fun, interactive game called **[Terminus](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)**.

### Instructions

1. Open the **Terminus game** in your browser.
2. Use the commands you’ve just learned to navigate through the game.
3. Focus on:
   - Finding and moving between different directories.
   - Listing files in a directory.
   - Creating new files and directories.
4. Spend around **15 minutes** exploring and practicing your CLI skills.

## Interactive Demo: Setting Up Git

Now that you've practiced with the command line, we’ll set up **Git** for version control in a project.

### Instructions

1. **Open the command line** and navigate to your project folder using the `cd` command.

   ```bash
   $ cd my-new-project
   ```

2. **Initialize a Git repository** by typing:

   ```bash
   $ git init
   ```

3. **Create a new file** called README.md:

   ```bash
   $ touch README.md
   ```

4. **Check the status** of your Git repository:

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

5. **Add the file** to the staging area:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   ```

6. **Commit the file** to save the changes:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Initial commit with README file"
   ```

You’ve now made your first Git commit! This means you’ve saved a snapshot of your project, and Git is now tracking it.

- What version control is and why it’s important in software development.
- How Git helps track changes in your projects.
- Basic command line commands to help you navigate and manage your projects.

In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into using Git to manage your project versions and collaborate with others using GitHub.
