## Introduction to the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The **command line interface (CLI)** allows you to interact with your computer by typing commands instead of using graphical tools. As a developer, you will often use the CLI to navigate your file system, run scripts, and work with version control systems like Git.

### How to Access the Command Line

#### On Windows

There are a few ways to access the command line in Windows, including the **Command Prompt**, **PowerShell**, or **Git Bash** (if installed).

1. **Command Prompt**:

   - **How to Access**:
     - Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog box.
     - Type `cmd` and press Enter.
     - This opens the **Command Prompt**, where you can type and execute commands.
   - **Limitations**: The Command Prompt lacks some of the advanced features developers may need, such as Unix-like commands (used in Git workflows).

2. **PowerShell**:

   - **How to Access**:
     - Search for **PowerShell** in the Start menu and open it.
   - **Benefits**: PowerShell is a more powerful tool than Command Prompt, with access to more advanced scripting and administrative commands. It supports most basic CLI operations, and many commands are the same as those used in Git Bash.

3. **Git Bash**:
   - **How to Access**:
     - If you have installed Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/), you should have **Git Bash** installed as well. Search for **Git Bash** in the Start menu and open it.
   - **Benefits**: Git Bash provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, supporting many Linux commands (such as `ls`, `pwd`, and `rm`) and all Git operations. This is the preferred tool for working with Git on Windows as it mimics the terminal environment used on Mac and Linux systems.

#### On macOS

Mac computers come with a **Terminal** application pre-installed, which provides native access to the command line.

1. **Terminal**:

   - **How to Access**:
     - Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight Search.
     - Type **Terminal** and press Enter to open it.
   - **Benefits**: The Terminal on macOS uses a Unix-based shell, which is similar to Git Bash on Windows. It allows you to execute the same commands that are widely used in software development, making it a powerful tool for working with the file system, running scripts, and managing version control.

2. **Git Bash (optional)**:
   - While the native Terminal is the primary tool for CLI operations on macOS, you can still install Git Bash if you prefer. However, it is unnecessary, as macOS's Terminal supports all required Git and Unix-based commands.

### Command Line Basics

Once you have opened the command line, you can start navigating through your computer's file system and running commands. The basic commands you will frequently use include `pwd` (print working directory), `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), and more.

1. **`pwd`** (Print Working Directory):

   - Displays the current directory you are working in.
     ```bash
     $ pwd
     ```

2. **`ls`** (List):

   - Lists all the files and directories in the current directory.
     ```bash
     $ ls
     ```

3. **`cd`** (Change Directory):

   - Changes to a different directory.
     ```bash
     $ cd [directory]
     ```

4. **`mkdir`** (Make Directory):

   - Creates a new directory (folder).
     ```bash
     $ mkdir [new-directory-name]
     ```

5. **`rm`** (Remove):
   - Deletes a file or directory (be cautious when using this command).
     ```bash
     $ rm [file-name]
     ```

These commands form the foundation of how you will navigate through your project files and directories as a developer.

## Introduction to Version Control

Version control is an essential tool for tracking changes to your project files over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.

### Why Use Version Control?

- **Collaboration**: Work with other developers on the same project.
- **History Tracking**: Keep a record of what changes were made, by whom, and when.
- **Reverting**: Easily revert to a previous version of your project if needed.

Here’s an example scenario to provide learners with additional context on why version control is important in the workplace:

---

## Scenario: Version Control in the Workplace

Imagine you are a front-end developer working for a company that is building a new e-commerce website. The project is large, and the team includes multiple developers, each responsible for different sections of the website, such as the homepage, product catalog, shopping cart, and user authentication.

### The Problem

You are assigned to develop the homepage, and you start by creating a basic layout in HTML and CSS. While you are working, another team member is adding functionality to the shopping cart. Both of you are making changes to the shared project files on the same server. Without version control, several issues could arise:

- **File Overwriting**: If you and your teammate both make changes to the same file (for example, the `styles.css` file), one person's changes might overwrite the other's without either of you knowing.
- **No Change History**: If a bug is introduced into the project, it will be difficult to pinpoint what caused the issue or who made the change, since there is no history of what has been modified.
- **Collaboration Roadblocks**: If two developers are working on the same feature at the same time, they might interfere with each other's progress, leading to confusion and delays.

### The Solution: Version Control

By using Git as your version control system, you and your teammates can avoid these problems. Here’s how Git would solve each of these issues:

1. **File Overwriting Prevention**:
   - Git allows each team member to work on their own **branch**, isolating their changes from the rest of the project. When you are ready to share your work, you can merge your branch back into the main branch, and Git will ensure that no changes are lost. If two people made conflicting changes to the same file, Git will flag the conflict, and you will be able to resolve it by reviewing both sets of changes.
2. **History of Changes**:

   - Every change made to the project is saved in a **commit**, which acts as a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message explaining what was changed and who made the changes. If a bug is introduced, you can review the history and **revert** to a previous version before the bug was introduced.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Multiple developers can work on the project simultaneously without stepping on each other’s toes. Even if you and your teammate are working on the same files, Git will manage those changes, ensuring that each person's contributions are preserved. Using **pull requests**, you can review each other's work before merging it into the main branch, maintaining code quality and avoiding errors.

### Outcome

With Git, your team is able to collaborate smoothly, track the history of changes, and quickly resolve conflicts without losing any work. This ensures that the project stays on track, and any issues that arise can be traced and fixed efficiently.

## GitHub Account Setup

To begin working with version control, you need to create an account on GitHub, a platform used to host and manage Git repositories. If you have not already created a GitHub account or installed Git, follow the instructions below to do so.

### Step-by-Step: Creating a GitHub Account

1. **Sign up for a GitHub Account**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click **Sign Up**.
   - Follow the instructions to create an account, ensuring you use a valid email address.
   - Remember, your GitHub account will be evidence of your work, so the username and email associated with it should be professional.
2. **Install Git**:

   - After setting up your GitHub account, you need to ensure that Git is installed on your local machine. Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
   - You can confirm that Git is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     $ git --version
     ```

3. **Configure Git with Your Account Information**:
   - After installation, configure Git with your GitHub account details:
     ```bash
     $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     $ git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
     ```

Now that your GitHub account is set up, you are ready to start tracking changes in your projects.

## Initializing a Git Repository

Now that you are familiar with the command line and have set up Git, you can start using version control in your project.

### Step-by-Step: Initializing a Git Repository

1. **Navigate to Your Project Folder**:

   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your project files are located.
     ```bash
     $ cd path/to/your/project
     ```

2. **Initialize a Git Repository**:

   - Run the following command to initialize Git in your project:
     ```bash
     $ git init
     ```

   This command creates a `.git` folder that allows Git to start tracking changes in your project.

3. **Check Git Status**:
   - You can use `git status` to see the state of your repository and any untracked files:
     ```bash
     $ git status
     ```
