# TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript Skills-Based Assessment (SBA)

## Overview

In this assessment, you will apply the skills you've developed throughout the TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript module to build a functional, real-world application. This project will test your understanding of TypeScript features, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, asynchronous operations, error handling, and API interaction. You will have 5.5 hours to complete this assessment.

You will create an **E-commerce Product Management System** using TypeScript. The final deliverable will include a **GitHub repository** with your project and a **written reflection** on your approach and the challenges you faced.

## Time Allotment

- **Time:** 5.5 hours

## Instructions

### Part 1: Project Setup

1. **Set Up Your Project**:

   - Create a new directory for the project and initialize it with npm:
     ```bash
     mkdir e-commerce-system
     cd e-commerce-system
     npm init -y
     ```

   - Install TypeScript and other necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev
     ```

   - Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript:
     ```bash
     npx tsc --init
     ```

2. **Organize Your Folder Structure**:
   - Your project should have the following structure:
     ```text
     e-commerce-system/
     ├── src/
     │   ├── models/
     │   │   ├── Product.ts
     │   ├── services/
     │   │   └── apiService.ts
     │   ├── utils/
     │   │   ├── discountCalculator.ts
     │   │   ├── errorHandler.ts
     │   │   └── taxCalculator.ts
     │   └── main.ts
     └── tsconfig.json
     ```

### Part 2: API Research

1. **API Research**:
   - Research and analyze the [Dummy JSON Products API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).
   - You will be implementing features that interact with this API.
2. **Project Planning**:
   - Based on your API research, plan the structure of your project. You will need to create API requests, handle errors, and display product information.
   - Before you begin coding, create a project plan and outline the steps you'll take to implement the API interactions and display product data.
   - Ensure you have thoroughly read through the requirements for the project below *before* you begin planning it.

---

### Part 3: Implementation

1. **Develop Product Class**:
   - **Product Base Class** (`Product.ts`):
     - Define a `Product` class that includes the appropriate properties based on data provided in the API response.
     - Include methods `displayDetails()` and `getPriceWithDiscount()`, and implement them appropriately based on the provided data.

2. **Implement Utilities**:
   - **Discount Calculator Module** (`discountCalculator.ts`):
     - Create a `calculateDiscount()` function to handle discount calculations for products.
     - This function should return the *dollar amount* that a product is discounted by. For example, if a product costs $100 and has a 10% discount, the function should return $10.
   - **Tax Calculator Module** (`taxCalculator.ts`):
     - Create a `calculateTax()` function to handle tax calculations for products.
     - This function should return the *dollar amount* that a product is taxed at. For example, if a product costs $100 and is taxed at 10%, the function should return $10.
     - Note that the `product` data returned from the API does not include a `taxPercentage` field like it includes a `discountPercentage` field. Apply a default standard tax rate of 4.75% to each product; however, products with a `category` of "groceries" should only be taxed at 3%.

4. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**:
   - **API Service** (`apiService.ts`):
     - Create API requests using `async/await` and Promises.
     - Implement functions to fetch product data and handle errors using `try/catch`.

5. **Error Handling Utility**:
   - **Error Handler Module** (`errorHandler.ts`):
     - Implement a custom error class and functions to handle different types of errors gracefully.

6. **Create the Main Application**:
   - **Main Entry File** (`index.ts`):
     - Import the product classes, tax calculator, and API service.
     - Create instances of `Product` by fetching product data from the API.
     - Use asynchronous functions to fetch product data and display it.
     - Demonstrate error handling and OOP principles in action.

### Part 4: Testing and Finalizing

1. **Compile Your Code**:
   - Use TypeScript to compile your code:
     ```bash
     npx tsc
     ```

2. **Run Your Application**:
   - Use Node.js to run your compiled JavaScript code:
     ```bash
     node dist/index.js
     ```

3. **Test and Debug**:
   - Test all functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
   - Check for any TypeScript errors or runtime issues and resolve them.

--- 

### Part 5: (Optional) User Interface

**Ensure the project is fully functional before creating a user interface.** With any additional time, you can implement a user interface for the application. Creating an interface will allow you to demonstrate your project in a more visually appealing way, as well as include it within your portfolio. 

1. **Create User Interface**:
   - Create a basic user interface using HTML.

2. **Implement User Interaction**:
   - Add event listeners to handle user input and interactions.
   - Update the UI based on user actions and API responses.

3. **Style the UI**:
   - Use CSS to style the user interface.

### Deliverables

You must submit the following items via **Canvas**:

1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Link to your GitHub repository with the complete project code.
   - Ensure your repository is publicly accessible or that the appropriate permissions are granted for review.

2. **Reflection Document**:
   - Write a reflection of roughly 300 words addressing:
     - How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.
     - The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
     - How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.
