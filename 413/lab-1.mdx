# Lab: TypeScript and Object-Oriented Programming

## Scenario
You are working as a software developer for a company that manages a large inventory of products. The inventory system must account for both physical items, like electronics and apparel, and digital products, such as e-books and software licenses. Due to the complexity of managing different product types, your team is shifting toward an object-oriented design that will simplify the codebase and make it easier to extend in the future.

Your supervisor has tasked you with building a prototype for an inventory tracker. This prototype should distinguish between physical and digital products, handle tax calculations based on product type, and manage the inventory in a structured way. You will leverage TypeScript and object-oriented programming to create reusable, scalable code and meet the team’s standards for type safety and maintainability.

To further improve this system, you will also develop a modular structure that separates concerns, making it easier to maintain and add features down the line. Once completed, this prototype will form the basis of the company’s inventory management application.

## Task
Create a simple object-oriented inventory tracker using TypeScript. The tracker will distinguish between **PhysicalProduct** and **DigitalProduct**, calculate applicable taxes, and manage inventory using **modules**. This lab will reinforce the key object-oriented programming concepts learned in the last lesson, including **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism**, while using TypeScript features such as type annotations and interfaces.

## Objective
By the end of this lab, you will demonstrate the ability to use TypeScript with type annotations, interfaces, and object-oriented programming concepts to build a small yet functional object-oriented system.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Your Project:**
   - Create a new directory for the project and initialize it with npm:
   
     ```bash
     mkdir inventory-tracker
     cd inventory-tracker
     npm init -y
     ```

   - Install TypeScript and other dependencies:
     
     ```bash
     npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev
     ```

   - Create a `tsconfig.json` file:
     
     ```bash
     npx tsc --init
     ```

   - Set up a basic folder structure for the project:

     ```
     inventory-tracker/
     ├── src/
     │   ├── models/
     │   │   ├── Product.ts
     │   │   ├── PhysicalProduct.ts
     │   │   └── DigitalProduct.ts
     │   ├── utils/
     │   │   └── taxCalculator.ts
     │   └── main.ts
     └── tsconfig.json
     ```

2. **Create the Product Base Class:**
   - Inside `src/models/Product.ts`, create a `Product` base class with the following:
     - Properties: `sku` (string), `name` (string), `price` (number).
     - Methods: 
       - `displayDetails()` - a method that returns a formatted string with the product's details.
       - `getPriceWithTax()` - a method that calculates the final price of the product with tax.

3. **Create the PhysicalProduct Subclass:**
   - Inside `src/models/PhysicalProduct.ts`, create a `PhysicalProduct` class that extends `Product`.
     - Add a `weight` property (number) for physical products.
     - Override the `getPriceWithTax()` method to calculate a final price that includes a 10% tax rate.
     - Use a **getter method** to return the formatted weight in kilograms (e.g. "2.5 kg").

4. **Create the DigitalProduct Subclass:**
   - Inside `src/models/DigitalProduct.ts`, create a `DigitalProduct` class that extends `Product`.
     - Add a `fileSize` property (number) for digital products.
     - Override the `getPriceWithTax()` method to calculate a final price with no tax, since the digital products do not require tax.
     - Use a **getter method** to return the formatted file size in megabytes.

5. **Create a Tax Calculator Utility:**
   - Inside `src/utils/taxCalculator.ts`, create a utility module to handle tax calculations. 
     - Add a function `calculateTax()` that accepts a `Product` object and returns the price including tax.

6. **Implement the Main Program:**
   - Inside `src/main.ts`, import the `PhysicalProduct` and `DigitalProduct` classes, and create instances of both.
   - Use a loop to display the details of each product, calculate prices with tax, and display the final prices.
       - Hint: Utilize polymorphism to your advantage here.

7. **Compile and Run the Program:**
   - Compile the TypeScript code:
     
     ```bash
     npx tsc
     ```

   - Run the compiled JavaScript:
     
     ```bash
     node dist/main.js
     ```

### Challenge

1. Add a `DiscountableProduct` interface that includes a method `applyDiscount()`. Implement this interface in one of the product classes.
2. Implement a module to handle sorting products by price or by name.
3. Add a new feature to the inventory system: **bulk discounts** for physical products over a certain quantity or size.

### Critical Thinking

After completing the lab, consider the following questions:
1. How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this object-oriented program?
2. How did inheritance reduce code duplication for `PhysicalProduct` and `DigitalProduct`?
3. What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) in this context?
4. If you had to add a new type of product (e.g., a `SubscriptionProduct`), how would polymorphism make this extension straightforward?

By completing this lab, you will demonstrate your understanding of TypeScript, type annotations, interfaces, and key object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
