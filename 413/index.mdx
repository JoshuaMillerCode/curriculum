# TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript

## Module Summary

This module introduces TypeScript, an essential tool for promoting type safety in JavaScript applications. You will also learn advanced JavaScript concepts such as asynchronous programming using Promises and async/await, effective error handling, and making HTTP requests using the Fetch API. These skills are critical for building robust, scalable web applications. By the end of this module, learners will have a thorough understanding of TypeScript and advanced JavaScript techniques, enabling them to write clean, reliable code and handle asynchronous tasks with confidence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
- Explain and utilize TypeScript to enforce type safety in JavaScript code.
- Apply asynchronous programming techniques using Promises and async/await.
- Handle errors in JavaScript applications effectively using try/catch blocks and custom error handling.
- Make HTTP requests using the Fetch API to retrieve and post data from/to servers.
- Understand and apply key JavaScript concepts such as closures, the event loop, and callback functions.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Write TypeScript code that enforces type safety and reduces common errors.
- Refactor existing JavaScript codebases into TypeScript.
- Manage asynchronous operations using Promises, async/await, and understand the implications of the JavaScript event loop.
- Handle errors in code execution gracefully with custom error handling strategies.
- Fetch, display, and manipulate data from remote APIs using Fetch.
