# TypeScript Generics and Advanced Types

## Workplace Context

Your team is developing a sophisticated e-commerce platform that requires reusable and adaptable data structures. You are tasked with building a product management module that should handle multiple data types without losing type safety. To achieve this, you will leverage **TypeScript Generics** and **Advanced Types**. These concepts will allow you to create more flexible, reusable, and type-safe code, making your application easier to maintain and extend as it grows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what generics are and how they enhance code flexibility while maintaining type safety.
- Create and use generic types, interfaces, and functions in TypeScript.
- Utilize advanced types, including intersections, unions, and type guards, to build complex and adaptable applications.

## Introduction to Generics

Generics provide a way to create reusable components that work with a variety of types without sacrificing type safety. They act like placeholders for types that you can specify later, similar to how a variable is a placeholder for a value.

Think of generics like the blueprints for a machine that can be customized with different parts — you can build the same machine with various configurations without creating separate blueprints each time.

### Why Use Generics?

In traditional programming, you might create a function that handles different data types separately, which can result in code duplication and limited flexibility. **Generics** solve this by allowing you to write a single function or data structure that works with different types while keeping your code type-safe.

### Basic Example: Generic Function

Here is a simple example of a generic function that accepts an argument of any type and returns it.

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

console.log(identity<string>("Hello"));
console.log(identity<number>(42));`
}} />

#### Explanation
- The `identity` function has a **generic parameter** `<T>` — `T` acts as a placeholder for any type.
- When calling the function, you specify the type you want to use (`<string>` or `<number>`).
- This provides flexibility without sacrificing type safety.

### Working with Generic Functions

You can use generics with arrays or other data structures to enforce type safety across collections.

#### Example: Generic Array Function

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `function getFirstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T {
  return arr[0];
}

console.log(getFirstElement<number>([1, 2, 3, 4]));  // Outputs 1
console.log(getFirstElement<string>(["a", "b", "c"]));  // Outputs "a"`
}} />

In this example:
- The `getFirstElement` function is a generic that accepts an array of any type (`T[]`) and returns the first element.
- Type safety is enforced throughout, ensuring that the return type matches the type of elements in the input array.

## Generic Interfaces and Classes

Generics are not limited to functions. You can create **generic interfaces** and **classes** that work with different data types, promoting code reuse while enforcing structure.

### Generic Interface

Let us create a generic interface for a data container.

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `interface DataContainer<T> {
  data: T;
  getData: () => T;
}

const numberContainer: DataContainer<number> = {
  data: 123,
  getData: function() {
    return this.data;
  }
};

const stringContainer: DataContainer<string> = {
  data: "TypeScript",
  getData: function() {
    return this.data;
  }
};

console.log(numberContainer.getData());  // Outputs 123
console.log(stringContainer.getData());  // Outputs "TypeScript"`
}} />

### Generic Class

Now, let’s see how generics can be applied to a class. Below is an example of a generic `Box` class that can hold any type of item.

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `class Box<T> {
  content: T;

  constructor(content: T) {
    this.content = content;
  }

  getContent(): T {
    return this.content;
  }
}

const stringBox = new Box<string>("Hello, TypeScript!");
const numberBox = new Box<number>(100);

console.log(stringBox.getContent());  // Outputs "Hello, TypeScript!"
console.log(numberBox.getContent());  // Outputs 100`
}} />

In this example:
- The `Box` class has a generic type `T` that is used for the `content` property and the `getContent` method.
- You can instantiate `Box` with different types while ensuring that type constraints are respected.

### Activity: Create a Generic Stack Data Structure

**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Instructions:**  

1. Create a file called `stack.ts`.
2. Implement a generic `Stack` class that supports operations like `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.
   - `push` should add an item of a generic type `T` to the stack.
   - `pop` should remove and return the item at the top of the stack.
   - `peek` should return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
3. Create instances of the `Stack` class for different data types (e.g., `number`, `string`) and demonstrate its functionality.

**Critical Thinking:** How does using generics in this activity prevent potential type-related errors? How would a non-generic version of the `Stack` class look, and what limitations would it have?

## Advanced Types in TypeScript

TypeScript offers several **advanced types** that allow you to create more complex and expressive data structures. These types include **intersections**, **unions**, and **type guards**.

### Intersection Types

An **intersection type** combines multiple types into one. A variable of an intersection type must satisfy all combined types.

Think of intersection types like merging two lists of requirements. The final result must meet all criteria from both lists.

#### Example: Intersection Type

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `interface HasName {
  name: string;
}

interface HasPrice {
  price: number;
}

type ProductWithDetails = HasName & HasPrice;

const product: ProductWithDetails = {
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 999.99
};

console.log(\`\${product.name} costs \$\${product.price}\`);`
}} />

In this example:
- `ProductWithDetails` is an intersection type combining `HasName` and `HasPrice`.
- The `product` object must have both `name` and `price` properties.

### Union Types

A **union type** allows a variable to hold one of several types. It’s like saying, “This could be one of multiple options.”

#### Example: Union Type

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `function formatInput(input: string | number): string {
  if (typeof input === "number") {
    return \`Number: \${input.toFixed(2)}\`;
  } else {
    return \`String: \${input.toUpperCase()}\`;
  }
}

console.log(formatInput(42.789));  // Outputs "Number: 42.79"
console.log(formatInput("hello"));  // Outputs "String: HELLO"`
}} />

In this example:
- `input` can be either a `string` or `number`, and the function handles each type differently.

### Type Guards

**Type guards** are used to narrow down a union type to a specific type during runtime. Type guards allow you to safely access properties and methods that are only available on certain types.

Think of type guards like traffic signs that guide the direction of your code depending on the type encountered.

#### Example: Type Guards

<CodeEditor template="vanilla-ts" language="typescript" showConsole files={{
  'index.ts': `interface Car {
  drive(): void;
}

interface Boat {
  sail(): void;
}

function operateVehicle(vehicle: Car | Boat) {
  if ("drive" in vehicle) {
    vehicle.drive();
  } else {
    vehicle.sail();
  }
}

const myCar: Car = { drive: () => console.log("Driving the car!") };
const myBoat: Boat = { sail: () => console.log("Sailing the boat!") };

operateVehicle(myCar);  // Outputs "Driving the car!"
operateVehicle(myBoat);  // Outputs "Sailing the boat!"`
}} />

In this example:
- The `in` operator checks whether the `vehicle` has a `drive` method, serving as a type guard.

### Activity: Use Advanced Types in a Web Application

**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Instructions:**  

1. Create a file called `dataProcessor.ts`.
2. Implement a function that takes a **union type** of `string[]` or `number[]` and returns a formatted string.
   - If the input is `string[]`, return a comma-separated list of uppercase strings.
   - If the input is `number[]`, return a comma-separated list of numbers rounded to two decimal places.
3. Use **type guards** to distinguish between `string[]` and `number[]`.
4. Add a **type alias** for the union type to keep the code concise.

**Critical Thinking:** How do union types and type guards make your code safer and more maintainable? What risks do they mitigate when dealing with complex data?
