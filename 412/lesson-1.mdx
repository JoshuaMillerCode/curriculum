# Introduction to the DOM

## Workplace Context

As a front-end developer, one of your primary responsibilities is to create interactive, dynamic web applications. To do this, you need to understand the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, which is the foundation of how browsers interpret and render HTML documents. The DOM provides a structured way to access, update, and manipulate the content of a webpage using JavaScript.

In this lesson, you will explore the basic structure of the DOM, learn how to select elements, and understand why the DOM is a key interface for building interactive web applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and structure of the DOM in web development.
- Identify key elements of the DOM, such as nodes and elements.
- Use modern JavaScript methods to select elements in the DOM.
- Inspect the DOM using browser Developer Tools.

## What is the DOM?

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects, allowing JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage.

The DOM acts as a bridge between the HTML content and JavaScript code, enabling dynamic updates to the document's structure, style, and content without reloading the entire page.

### Key Concepts

1. **Nodes**: The DOM is structured as a tree of nodes. Nodes can represent elements, attributes, text, or other components of the document.
2. **Elements**: Elements are a type of node that represent HTML tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`).
3. **Document Object**: The `document` object is the root of the DOM tree and represents the entire webpage.

> **Analogy**: Think of the DOM as a family tree, where each element is a family member (node) with parent, child, and sibling relationships.

### Example: Interactive DOM Visualizer

Take a look at the [interactive DOM visualizer](https://bioub.github.io/dom-visualizer/) below, built by Romain Bohdanowicz. It allows you to view the DOM structure of an HTML document, which you can interact with. Try adding some elements!

> **Note:** Due to the use of iframes, you will need to click "update" to initialize the visualizer. You can also open the visualizer in a new tab using the link above.

## Selecting Elements in the DOM

To interact with elements in the DOM, we need to select them using JavaScript. Modern JavaScript offers several methods for element selection:

1. **`getElementById()`**: Selects an element by its `id` attribute.
2. **`getElementsByClassName()`**: Selects elements by their class name (returns a collection).
3. **`querySelector()`**: Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
4. **`querySelectorAll()`**: Selects all elements that match a CSS selector (returns a NodeList).

### Example Code Block

<CodeEditor template="html" showPreview files={{
  "index.html": `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  <title>DOM Selection Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="main-title">Hello, World!</h1>
  <p class="description">This is a simple paragraph.</p>
  <button id="action-btn">Change Text</button>

  <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>`,
    'script.js': `// Selecting elements
const title = document.getElementById('main-title');
const paragraph = document.querySelector('.description');
const button = document.querySelector('#action-btn');

// Manipulating content
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    title.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
    paragraph.textContent = 'The paragraph text has changed.';
});`
}} />

In this example:
- We use `getElementById()` to select the heading.
- We use `querySelector()` to select the paragraph and button.
- We add an event listener to update the text content when the button is clicked.

## Inspecting the DOM with Developer Tools

One of the best ways to explore and understand the DOM is by using browser Developer Tools.

### Steps to Inspect the DOM
1. Open your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Right-click on any element on the page and select **Inspect**.
3. Navigate to the **Elements** tab to see the DOM tree.
4. Hover over elements in the DOM tree to highlight them on the webpage.

> **Pro Tip**: You can edit the HTML directly in the Developer Tools to see live changes on the page. This is useful for testing and debugging.

---

## Activity: Exploring the DOM

### Task
Open the Developer Tools on a webpage of your choice (e.g., https://perscholas.org/). Use the **Elements** tab to:
- Inspect the structure of the DOM.
- Select an element and change its text content directly in the Developer Tools.
- Use the **Console** tab to write JavaScript code that changes the content of an element.

### Reflection
Discuss your findings with a partner. What elements did you inspect? How did the page change when you modified the content?
